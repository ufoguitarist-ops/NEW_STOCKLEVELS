# Guntrader Stock Check – Phase 4 (Final)

Phase 4 finalises the app:

- Clear explanation of **global low-stock alerts**
- Alerts are **repo-controlled** (Option A)
- Low-stock-only view emphasised for reordering
- Model drill-down retained
- Clean, professional UI ready for daily use

## How to change alert thresholds
Edit:
`/data/lowStockAlerts.json`

Commit & push → everyone sees updated alerts immediately.
